### Irish Language Model
In the Irish language model I present an analysis of various machine learning methods used for modeling the use of diacritics in the Irish language. Irish Gaelic has one diacritic mark or long accent which indicates that the vowel is to be pronounced long. Words with or without a long accented vowel take on completely different meanings:
* Eire (AY-reh): "Ireland"
* Eire (EH-reh): "Burden"

The code found in this repo shows my attempt to classify non-accented/accented word pairs in the Irish language. The task was presented as a class competition on Kaggle, and all models' performance were measured with Log Loss.
