Includes projects and code from my machine learning course.

### Irish Language Model
In the Irish language model I presented an analysis of various machine learning methods used for modeling the use of diacritics in the Irish language. Irish Gaelic has one diacritic mark or long accent which indicates that the vowel is to be pronounced long. Words with or without a long accented vowel take on completely different meanings, for example:
* Eire (AY-reh): "Ireland"
* Eire (EH-reh): "Burden"

The code found in this repo shows my attempt to classify non-accented/accented word pairs in the Irish language. The task was presented as a class competition on Kaggle, and each model's performance was measured with the Log Loss metric.

### Skin Cancer MNIST

For this project I presented a comparative analysis of traditional learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms, highlighting the effectiveness of each approach on the classification of skin cancer images from the HAM10K dataset. This set of images was collected over a period of 20 years from patients of varying ages and includes seven types of cancerous skin lesions and ground truth annotations for each image.
